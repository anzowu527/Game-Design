Real snowfall

The asset includes 3 snowfall prefabs and a real cloud prefab.

For viewing, you can use an animated camera that guides you around the scene, or use the FPS controller and walk in open space yourself.
To enable the animated camera, disable the FPS controller in the inspector panel and enable the camera.

To use, just place your chosen prefab on your Scene and enjoy.
