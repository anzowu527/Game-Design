# Game Design Final Project
## The Map-Viewport-Interface-Input.pdf includes our initial thoughts and description of our map, viewport, interface, and input designs.
## The Final Game Design Document.pdf introduces our team members, includes precise gameplay overview, player base, comparable games, final game map and navigation, game art, sample game play description, and techinical Features.
## The rest of the files in this repository compose the game. Although I didn't upload the 'PackageCache' file that I have in my local machine, I tried to download what is on this repository and imported to the Unity, the game run fine.
