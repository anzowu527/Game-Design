# Game Design Final Project
### File Descriptions
- The Map-Viewport-Interface-Input.pdf includes our initial thoughts and description of our map, viewport, interface, and input designs.
- The Final Game Design Document.pdf introduces our team members, includes precise gameplay overview, player base, comparable games, final game map and navigation, game art, sample game play description, and techinical Features.
- The rest of the files in this repository compose the game. Although I didn't upload the 'PackageCache' file that I have in my local machine, I tried to download what is on this repository and imported to the Unity, the game run fine.
- 'Asset' folder: has all the assets in each level, including the motion scripts, which is written in C#
- 'Scene' folder: includes the 5 scenes of our game (Mainmenu, level1, level2, level3, level4), some other testing scenes, and some assets that applies to all the scenes.
### Steps to open our game 
1. Make sure you have UnityHub downloaded, the version we used is 3.7.0: [https://unity.com/](https://unity.com/unity-hub)
2. Obtain and extract the ZIP file of my repository, removing any PDF files from the folder.
3. Launch the app and sign in.
4. Navigate to 'Projects' on the left side of the window to access the Projects panel on the right.
5. Click the small triangle next to the 'Add' button to reveal a dropdown menu.
6. Select 'Add project from disk' and locate the folder you extracted in step 2. If it doesn't work, try renaming the folder before attempting again.
7. The project should now appear in the panel; open it by double-clicking.
8. If this is your first time opening the project, you might see an untitled scene. Go to the project panel, typically at the bottom right, and open the 'Scenes' folder found under 'Assets'.
9. Double-click the 'Mainmenu' scene to open it, or choose another scene to start with.
10. Press the start button, usually located in the upper middle, to activate the main menu.
11. Select any level to begin playing. For gameplay instructions, refer to the help button or consult the Final Game Design Document.

### You can also export our game and try it in a better setting
1. In the Unity Editor, select the 'File' menu in the top-left corner when you have the game opened (follow the above steps 1-7).
2. Navigate to 'Build Settings' to open the build options window.
3. Verify that all necessary scenes are listed in the 'Scenes in Build' area. If any are missing, add them by clicking 'Add Open Scenes'.
4. Select your desired 'Target Platform' and 'Architecture'â€”for instance, macOS with Intel 64-bit + Apple Silicon support.
5. Press the 'Build and Run' button located at the lower-right of the window. Specify your preferred save location for the build, and Unity will compile and run your project.
